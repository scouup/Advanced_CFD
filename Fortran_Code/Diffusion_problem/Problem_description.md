**5. ** We shall solve the transient laminar flow problem numerically, by the following algorithm: the explicit Euler scheme in time, and central finite-difference in space,

\[
\frac{u_{j}^{n+1} - u_{j}^{n}}{\Delta t} = g + \nu \frac{u_{j-1}^{n} - 2u_{j}^{n} + u_{j+1}^{n}}{\Delta y^{2}},
\tag{8}
\]

where \(\Delta y = 2L/N\), \(u_{j}^{n} = u(y_{j}, t_{n})\) with \(y_{j} = -L + (j - 1)\Delta y\) and \(t_{n} = n\Delta t\) (\(n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\)). The two end nodes \(j = 1\) and \(j = N + 1\) are located on the channel walls. Assume \(L = 1\), \(u_{0} \equiv gL^{2}/(2\nu) = 1\), and \(\nu = 0.1\). The time step size will be set according to \(\Delta t = 0.32\Delta y^{2}/\nu\).

### Key Details Extracted:
1. **Numerical Scheme**:  
   - Explicit Euler in time.
   - Central finite-difference in space.
   - Equation (8) defines the update for \(u_j^{n+1}\).

2. **Parameters**:  
   - \(L = 1\) (channel half-width).
   - \(\nu = 0.1\) (kinematic viscosity).
   - \(u_0 \equiv gL^2/(2\nu) = 1\) (reference velocity scale).
   - Time step: \(\Delta t = 0.32 \Delta y^2 / \nu\).

3. **Spatial Discretization**:  
   - \(\Delta y = 2L/N\) (grid spacing).
   - Domain: \(y_j = -L + (j-1)\Delta y\) for \(j = 1, 2, \ldots, N+1\).
   - Wall boundaries at \(j=1\) and \(j=N+1\).

4. **Temporal Discretization**:  
   - \(t_n = n \Delta t\) (time levels).

### Derived Quantities:
- **Gravity term \(g\)**:  
  From \(u_0 = gL^2/(2\nu) = 1\):  
  \[
  g = \frac{2\nu u_0}{L^2} = \frac{2 \times 0.1 \times 1}{1^2} = 0.2.
  \]
  
- **Time step \(\Delta t\)**:  
  \[
  \Delta t = 0.32 \frac{\Delta y^2}{\nu} = 0.32 \frac{\Delta y^2}{0.1} = 3.2 \Delta y^2.
  \]

### Boundary Conditions:
- No-slip walls: \(u_1^n = 0\) and \(u_{N+1}^n = 0\) for all \(n\).

This setup is used for simulating transient laminar flow in a channel with half-width \(L\), driven by a constant body force \(g\). The scheme is conditionally stable since \(0.32 < 0.5\) (stability limit for the diffusion term).
